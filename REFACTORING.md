# Database Refactoring Progress

This document tracks the progress of refactoring the application to use the new database schema.

## Overview

We are refactoring the application to use a new database schema that addresses several issues with the current database:

1. Data duplication
2. Missing activity tracking
3. Inconsistent naming conventions
4. Missing personal information

The new database schema uses singular table names (e.g., `user` instead of `users`) and includes new tables for activity tracking, user statistics, and more.

## Large File Handling

Files exceeding 800 lines should be refactored into smaller modules following these guidelines:

1. Split files along logical boundaries
2. Create an index file for backward compatibility
3. Update imports in dependent files
4. Document the new file structure

### Refactored Large Files

| Original File | New Structure | Status | Date |
|---------------|---------------|--------|------|
| backend/api/communities.js | community-*.js modules | Completed | 2/26/2025 |

## Refactoring Plan Maintenance

This refactoring plan should be updated when:

1. New large files are identified for refactoring
2. New patterns or issues are discovered during refactoring
3. Changes to the database schema require additional refactoring
4. New functionality needs to be integrated with the refactored code
